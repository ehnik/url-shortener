This project shortens a submitted URL using a simple React interface and a
Node/Express backend.

Note: There is not a backend database as of now, so the shortened URLs are valid
until the server is restarted.

To run:

1) Install dependencies via NPM and run $ node server.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
